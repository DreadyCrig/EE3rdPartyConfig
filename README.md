EE3rdPartyConfig
================

ExpressionEngine 3rd Party Add-On Config settings. For use with things like [FocusLab's EE Master Config](https://github.com/focuslabllc/ee-master-config).

FocusLab's Master Config helps us effortlessly develop and deploy EE sites across different platforms. We also use it to bootstrap some common configuration settings for 3rd party add-ons that we turn to regularly.

The config.master.php file in this repo contains how we would commonly configure those 3rd party add-ons.  Some are configured specifically to suit our own folder structures (which may vary from how you run your EE setups), as well as settings that we've found work best for our use.
